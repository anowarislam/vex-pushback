**Total Learning Time:** ~5 hours (spread across multiple sessions)

## Before You Start

### What You Need
- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed
- [VEX Robotics Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vexrobotics.vexcode) installed
- This repository cloned to your computer
- Enthusiasm to learn! (No coding experience required)

### Optional But Helpful
- Access to a VEX V5 robot for hands-on practice
- A friend or teammate to learn with

## How These Tutorials Work

### Each Tutorial Includes:

1. **Real-World Analogy** - We connect every concept to things you already know
2. **Explanation** - Clear, step-by-step breakdown of the concept
3. **Code Connection** - We show exactly where this applies in your robot code
4. **ASCII Diagram** - Visual representation (works everywhere!)
5. **Exercise** - Hands-on practice to cement your learning

### Symbols You'll See

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `code` | This is actual code you can run |
| **Bold** | Important term or concept |
| *Italic* | Emphasis or new vocabulary |
| > Quote | Tips and helpful hints |
| :warning: | Watch out! Common mistake ahead |

## The Push Back Game (2025-2026)

This tutorial series prepares you for the **Push Back** competition:

```
    +----------------------------------------------------------+
    |                    PUSH BACK FIELD                        |
    |                      12' x 12'                            |
    |                                                           |
    |   [LONG GOAL]          [CENTER]          [LONG GOAL]     |
    |   10 pts/zone           6-8 pts          10 pts/zone     |
    |                                                           |
    |              88 BLOCKS scattered on field                 |
    |                                                           |
    |   [PARK ZONE]                           [PARK ZONE]      |
    |   RED 8-30 pts                          BLUE 8-30 pts    |
    +----------------------------------------------------------+

    AUTONOMOUS: 15 seconds (10 pt bonus available)
    DRIVER:     1 minute 45 seconds
```

**Key Game Elements:**
- Score blocks (3 pts each)
- Control zones (6-10 pts each)
- Park robots (8 pts one, 30 pts both!)
- Descore opponent blocks (allowed!)

## Learning Path Options

### Path A: Structured Learning (Recommended)
Follow tutorials 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 in order

### Path B: I Already Know Some Python
Skip to [3. Python Basics](03-python-basics/) to check your knowledge, then continue

### Path C: Just Here for Competition
Jump to [6. Competition Strategy](06-competition-strategy/) (but you may need to backtrack)

### Path D: Quick Reference
Go directly to [Appendix](appendix/) for cheat sheets and troubleshooting

## Your Robot's Code Files

Throughout these tutorials, you'll work with these files:

```
src/
├── main.py           ← Entry point (runs on the Brain)
├── robot_config.py   ← Motor and sensor setup
├── autonomous.py     ← 15-second autonomous routines
├── driver_control.py ← Tank and arcade drive modes
└── utils.py          ← Helper functions
```

You'll understand every line of these files by the end of this series!
