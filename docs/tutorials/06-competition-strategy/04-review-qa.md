**49. Descoring Math:**
A zone has 5 blocks: 3 Blue, 2 Red.
- Blue currently controls the zone (+10 pts Blue)

You descore 2 Blue blocks. Now it's: 1 Blue, 2 Red.

## Section 4: Calculation Problems

**46.** 12 blocks × 3 pts = **36 points**

**47.** 10 + 8 = **18 zone points**

**48.** 30 - 8 = **22 additional points**

**49.** Blue loses 10 + Red gains 10 = **20 point swing**

**50.**
- Blocks: 18 × 3 = 54
- Long goals: 2 × 10 = 20
- Center upper: 1 × 8 = 8
- Center lower: 0
- Parking: 30
- Autonomous: 10
- **TOTAL: 122 points**

**51.**
- Option A: 3 points
- Option B: 30 - 8 = 22 additional points
- **Better: Option B (park)**

**52.**
- To tie: Blue needs 2 blocks (6-6)
- To win: Blue needs 3 blocks (7-6)

**53.** **No** - Only scored in 2 goals (need 3+)

**54.**
- Option A: 5 × 3 = 15 points
- Option B: 30 - 8 = 22 additional points
- **Better: Option B (park)**

**55.**
- 44 × 3 = 132 (blocks)
- 10 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 34 (zones)
- Parking: 30
- Autonomous: 10
- **MAXIMUM: 206 points**

**Score: ___ / 10**

## Section 5: Scenario-Based

| # | Answer | Explanation |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 56 | **B** | Change one routine to avoid collision |
| 57 | **B** | Defend the goal to protect your zone control |
| 58 | **B** | Park! Double park (30) > single (8) + 9 = 17 |
| 59 | **B** | Use each robot's strengths: fast scores, strong defends |
| 60 | **Scoring is better** - Adding 3 Red blocks creates control (3-4 = no control, but 3-4 means Blue still has majority). Actually, descoring is better: removing 3 Blue leaves 1-0, AND denies them 10 pts. Point swing = 20 pts vs scoring 9 pts. **Descoring = bigger advantage** |
| 61 | **B** | Your alliance gains 30 pts by double parking while they get 0 |
| 62 | **B** | Pre-planned hand signals work in noisy venues |
| 63 | **B** | Adding 1 block breaks the tie, giving 6 pts zone control |

**Score: ___ / 8**

## Key Concepts Summary

### Essential Numbers to Remember
- Field: **12' × 12'**
- Blocks: **88 total** (44 each)
- Match: **2 minutes** (15 sec auto + 1:45 driver)
- Block scored: **3 points**
- Long Goal zone: **10 points**
- Center Upper zone: **8 points**
- Center Lower zone: **6 points**
- Single park: **8 points**
- Double park: **30 points**
- Autonomous bonus: **10 points**

### Critical Strategy Points
1. **Descoring is allowed** - removing opponent blocks is legal
2. **Zone control requires MAJORITY** - ties give no points
3. **Double park is huge** - 30 pts is almost always worth it
4. **10-second rule** - stop scoring and park at 1:50
5. **AWP needs ALL 4 requirements** - 7+ blocks, 3+ goals, 3+ loader, no barrier

### Alliance Coordination Essentials
1. **Pre-match:** Discuss autonomous, roles, zones, end-game
2. **During match:** Use hand signals in noisy venues
3. **Zone division:** Each robot owns left or right
4. **End game:** Both robots MUST park for 30 pts
