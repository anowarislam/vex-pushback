# Answer Key

## Section 1: True or False

1. **T** - Newton's First Law (objects at rest stay at rest)
2. **T** - F = ma, so more mass needs more force for same acceleration
3. **F** - Momentum = mass × velocity (depends on both)
4. **T** - F = ma, double F means double a (if m is constant)
5. **F** - Trade-off: heavy = harder to push, light = faster but easier to push
6. **F** - BLUE has the LEAST torque (more speed)
7. **F** - OPPOSITE! Higher ratio = more torque, less speed
8. **T** - GREEN (18:1) is balanced, commonly used for drivetrains
9. **F** - You MUST change both code AND physical cartridge
10. **T** - Bigger wheels = more distance, but need more force to accelerate
11. **F** - Static friction is STRONGER than kinetic
12. **T** - That's exactly what the rollers do
13. **F** - Traction wheels make turning HARDER (scrubbing)
14. **T** - Low center of gravity = more stable
15. **F** - Wider track width = slower turns, but more stable
